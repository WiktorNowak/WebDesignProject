<h1>Facts and fiction.</h1>
             <section>
                <p> 
                   Many conspiricy theorists believe that the hubble doesnt exist and that all the pictures that it has taken are purely drawn concepts of the stars and other galaxies.
                    This however in my opinion is complete nonsense. With much photographical evidence to prove that these are indeed not just drawings.
                 They are however edited to have color as the hubbke takes multiple pictures of the same planet or supernova in Red green and blue and are then connected to make the stunning photography we see today.</p>

    <h2>Facts</h2>
    <section class="col_detail">
        <p>
            A few facts about space.
        </p>
    </section>
    
    <h3>Fact 1</h3>
    <section class="col_detail">
        <img width="600"; height="400"; src="images/space.jpg" alt="space" />
        <p>
            Space is completely silent.There is no atmosphere in space, which means that sound has no medium or way to travel to be heard. Astronauts use radios to stay in communication while in space, since radio waves can still be sent and received.
        </p>
    </section>
    
    <h4>Fact 2</h4>
     <section class="col_detail">
        <img width="600"; height="400"; src="images/water.jpg" alt="Water in space" />
        <p>
            There is floating water in space. Astronomers have found a massive water vapor cloud which holds 140 trillion times the mass of water in the Earth’s oceans somewhere around 10 billion light years away – making it the largest discovery of water ever found.
        </p>
    </section>
    
     <h5>Fact 3</h5>
     <section class="col_detail">
        <img width="600"; height="400"; src="images/Volcanoonmars.jpg" alt="Mars voclano" />
        <p>
           here is a volcano on Mars three times the size of Everest. At 600 km wide and 21 km high, Olympus Mons is a volcano on Mars that may still be active, according to scientists. It is the tallest peak of any planet. However, the Rheasilvia central peak on the asteroid Vesta is taller at 22 km

    <h6>Fiction</h6>
    <section class="col_detail">
        <p>
           Here are some space myths and fiction. 
        </p>
    </section>
    
      <h7>Myth 1</h7>
     <section class="col_detail">
        <img width="600"; height="400"; src="images/idiots.jpg" alt="flat earth" />
        <p>
            The Earth is flat, or at least some people believe it is. This myth is so popular that there is even a group named after it: the Flat Earth Society. Members of the organization argue that the horizon is always at eye level, which they say would not be possible if the Earth were round. They also say there is no full movie of the Earth rotating from space — which is not true, as NASA has published multiple videos taken from satellites, including a live video of Earth from the ISS, which orbits our planet 16 times per day.

        </p>
    </section>
   
      <h8>Myth 2</h8>
     <section class="col_detail">
        <img width="600"; height="400"; src="images/spcaewoman.jpg" alt="woman in space" />
        <p>
            We explode in space, well not really. Exposure to space will definitely kill you, but not instantly and not in such a visceral way. A human being can survive exposed to space for about half a minute with no permanent damage. It won’t be pleasant, but it’s not instant death. You would probably die of asphyxiation due to lack of oxygen. 

        </p>
    </section>
    
    
       <h9>Myth 3</h9>
     <section class="col_detail">
        <img width="600"; height="400"; src="images/asteroid.jpg" alt="asteroid belt" />
        <p>
            You can’t travel through an asteroid belt. One of the main things that movies are bad at when it comes to space is accurately portraying size. And it’s not really their fault. If they were to show things how they really were, they’d just show a black screen with a tiny dot here and there which was meant to be a planet or something. The idea here is that space is big. Really, really, really big. Even if an asteroid belt has millions and millions of asteroids in it, you’d have to be the unluckiest person in the universe to hit one. It’s not impossible, but the chances are astronomical.
