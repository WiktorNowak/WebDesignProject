     <h1>Hubble Telescope</h1>

                <p> 
                  On April 24, 1990, the space shuttle Discovery lifted off from Earth with the Hubble Space Telescope nestled securely in its payload bay.
                    The following day, Hubble was released into space, ready to peer into the vast unknown. Since then, Hubble has reinvigorated and reshaped
                    our perception of the cosmos and uncovered a universe of unexpected wonders. Hubble has revealed properties of space and time that for most
                    of human history were only probed in the imaginations of scientists and philosophers. Today, Hubble continues to provide views of cosmic
                    wonders never before seen and is at the forefront of many new discoveries. This is the telescope in space hovering over the earth.

                  <h1>First Image from Hubble</h1>
            <section class="col_detail">
                <img width="90%" src="images/firstimage.jpg" alt="First image from Hubble" />
                <p> 
                    This "first light" image from Hubble was released in May 1990, to illustrate the telescope's improved resolution when compared to ground-based observatories.
                    On the right is part of the first image taken with the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field/Planetary Camera. It is shown with a ground-based picture of the 
                    same region of the sky from Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. The Las Campanas picture was taken with a 100-inch telescope and it is typical of high-quality
                    pictures obtained from the ground. The images of the stars in the ground-based picture are fuzzy, and in some cases overlap, because of the smearing effect of
                    Earth's atmosphere. The same stars in the Hubble frame are sharper, as shown by the double star at the top of the image. In this early engineering picture, the
                    Hubble images are roughly 50 percent sharper than the ground-based images.

            <h1>Triangulum Galaxy</h1>
            <section class="col_detail">
                <img width="90%" src="images/recentimage.jpg" alt="Triangulum Galaxy" />
                <p> 
                    NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has produced its largest mosaic image ever of the Triangulum galaxy (M33). This image spans 14,500 light-years.
                    Triangulum seems to have emerged from the ages having interacted little with other galaxies, maintaining a neat, organized spiral and plenty of material for churning out new stars. Astronomers will investigate the impact of Triangulum's high star formation rate density as they comb through the huge trove of data gathered by Hubble. These contradictory features — a quiet past coupled to vigorous star formation — make Triangulum a fascinating member of the Local Group, providing key comparisons and contrasts with the Milky Way and our most massive neighbor, Andromeda.
                    This mosaic was created from images taken by Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) between February 2017 and February 2018. The panoramic image will be presented at the 233rd meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Seattle, Washington
