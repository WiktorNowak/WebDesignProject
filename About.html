                Nasa is one of the most recognisable space exploriation and research organisations in the world. It was originaly formed in the late 1950's to enccourage peacefull applications is space science.
                    NASA science is focused on better understanding Earth through the Earth Observing System. Nasa's major part in the hubble telescopes lifespan is serviving and maintaining it in orbit.Shortly after the Hubble Space Telescope was deployed in 1990, the observatory's primary mirror was discovered to have an aberration that affected the clarity of the telescope's early images. Fortunately, Hubble was the first telescope designed to be visited in space by astronauts to perform repairs, replace parts and update its technology with new instruments. Astronauts first visited Hubble in orbit in December 1993. Including that trip, there have been five astronaut servicing missions to Hubble. Nasa also complete space walks when the telescope was launched to make sure that everything was in order, these space walks took any thing from 3 to 5 days to complete to make sure that everything was fine.
